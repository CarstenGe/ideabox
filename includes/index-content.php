	<h3>What's Ideabox?</h1>
	<div class="grey-box">
		<p>Ideabox is a website where anyone can post a fun idea for an app, website or graphic product. 
		The intention is that the people who post here can't really carry out the idea themselves.
		By posting here, their ideas can be created by some volunteer who can carry out the project for them.</p>

	<h3 name="rules">Rules</h1>
	<div class="grey-box">
		<ul>
			<li>Every idea you post here belongs to everyone now.</li>
			<li>You have to make sure your idea doesn't violate copyright laws before posting.</li>
			<li>Don't post any offensive ideas.</li>
			<li>All posts must be written in English.</li>
			<li>You can't charge people money for carrying out an idea. A small compensation (e.g. a thank you card and a box of chocolates) upon completing a project is allowed but completely up to you.</li>
